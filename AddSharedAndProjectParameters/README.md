## What is it?

It is Python script which can be used directly in dynamo in Python block. You can make a node from it.

## What to do when I want to use it as a script in Dynamo

* Create Excel sheet - name it "SharedParameters" and fill the data (follow th structure)
You can name it as you wish, but do not forget to change it in dynamo.

* Copy/Paste into your Dynamo
* Connect with Dynamo nodes
* Link the excel file to Dynamo node
* Play the dynamo on project

In order to work, the Revit project must have created and connected Shared parameter file.
