## What is it?

It is Python script which can be used directly in dynamo in Python block. You can also make your own node from it.

## What to do when I want to use it as a script in Dynamo

* Create Excel file, in it Sheet with name "SharedParameters" and fill sheet with desired data (follow the structure or change the order in script).
You can name the sheet as you wish, but do not forget to change it in Dynamo as well.

* Copy/Paste the code into your Dynamo
* Connect with Dynamo other nodes
* Link the excel file to Dynamo node
* Play the dynamo on project

In order to work, the Revit project must have created and connected Shared parameter file.
